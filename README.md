## User Stories

- [x] prediction of weight(kg) of a human if height(cm) is given
 
This application is created using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Pandas library. DataSet is related to height\(cm) and weight(kg) relationship of a person, predicting the probabilistic weight on a given height, once a cost function is established between these two variables.
